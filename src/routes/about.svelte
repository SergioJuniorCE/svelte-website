Introduce yourself!
An About page serves as the place for a blogger to introduce themselves to the audience. Your About page should discuss:

Who you are
The topics you write about and are interested in
Facts about you, your career, and your blog
Photos of you
While the list above is a basic outline, make sure your About page is captivating and encourages readers to take a specific action such as subscribing to your blog. Have fun with your About page and make it all about you.
